# 🏀 NBA Shooting Clusters - PCA Analysis

This project explores NBA player shooting tendencies using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques. By reducing high-dimensional shooting data into an interpretable 2D space, we uncover patterns in player shot selection and efficiency.

### 📊 Project Overview

- Aggregates NBA player shooting stats by season
- Incorporates Per 36 Minutes data to account for shot volume
- Applies PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Implements interactive scatter plots for player insights

### 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1️⃣ Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/okonma01/nba-pca.git
cd nba-pca
```

2️⃣ Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```

-- 

### 📈 Key Findings

- Distinct player shooting archetypes emerged (spot up shooters, mid-range specialists, iso scorers).
- PCA successfully approximates high-dimensional data while retaining key shot profile information.
Visualizing plot helps in comparing players with similar shot tendencies.

### 🚀 Next Steps

✅ Experiment with t-SNE or UMAP for alternative dimensionality reduction.
✅ Use hierarchical clustering for deeper analysis.
✅ Extend analysis to include playmaking, defense, or overall scoring efficiency.
